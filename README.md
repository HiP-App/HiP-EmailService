## Technolgies and Requirements:
HiP-EmailService is a REST API built on .NET Core 1.1 . Below are the requirements needed to build and develop this project,
 * [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#windows) for Windows, Linux or macOS.
 
## Using this API in another .NET application

If you want to call this API programatically from another .NET application, the recommended way is generating a client class automatically via [autorest](https://github.com/Azure/autorest).

1. Install the autorest tool
2. Run the EmailService and then download the swagger.json from localhost:5002/swagger/v1/swagger.json and save it to your project directory
3. Create the client by running the following command (change the `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME` string, obviously)
``` bash
autorest -Input swagger.json -CodeGenerator CSharp -OutputDirectory . -Namespace PaderbornUniversity.SILab.Hip.YOUR_PROJECT_NAME -ClientName EmailClient
```
4. Move the generated `EmailClient.cs`, `IEmailClient.cs` and `EmailClientExtensions.cs` into a newly created folder `Clients` and change their `namespace` declarations by adding `.Clients` to their end
5. You can now instantiate the `EmailClient` via `new EmailClient()` and then call the REST API methods of the EmailService using it's async methods.
 
## IDE Options
 * Visual Studio 2017
 * Visual Studio Code with [C# extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp).

## Getting started

 * Clone the repository.
 * Create a new file `appsettings.Development.json` at `scr/EmailService`. (See `src/EmailService/appsettings.Development.json.example`).
 * Update the new `appsettings.Development.json` file to match your needs.
 * To run using Visual Studio, just start the app with/without debugging.
 * To run through terminal,
  * Navigate to `src/EmailService`
  * Set Environment Variable 
		* Windows: `set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`
		* Linux/macOS: `export ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development`
  * Before your first run, execute `dotnet restore`
  * Execute `dotnet run`
  * `{{BaseUrl}}/swagger` will give information about the service endpoints.

### VS Code Setup

For getting the project to run with Visual Studio Code, you will have to execute a few more steps:

 * go to the Debug view and click the run button - you will be asked if a launch configuration should be created (click yes)
 * in the created `tasks.json`, add the following line: `"options": { "cwd": "${workspaceRoot}/src/EmailService" },`
 * in the created `launch.json`:
   * replace every occurence of `${workspaceRoot}` with `${workspaceRoot}/src/EmailService`
   * add `"env": { "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development" }` to your run configurations
